<h3> How does this whole thing <span>work?</span></h3>
<p>We make getting a beautiful home easy for you with a simple and clear design process.<BR><BR>

1.	Take our survey – after signing up for our service, answer a few questions about your personal style through our online survey, and upload pictures of the room that you want decorated.
<BR><BR>2. Chat with us – your designer will contact you within three business days of receiving your survey and chat with you over the phone to discuss your needs, style preferences, and vision for your space.
<BR><BR>3. See concepts – you will receive two design concepts for your space. Choose which concept you prefer.
<BR><BR>4.	Receive revisions—after choosing your favorite concept, your designer will provide you with three further options for any product selections that you aren’t happy with.
<BR><BR>5.	Get decorated – you get a final room visualization and list of products and prices. Choose what you’d like to purchase, and our accounts team will take care of ordering and arranging delivery for you.

<div class = "question">	
<h3>This sounds like it costs an arm and a leg, and I'm not sure that I actually want to sell my appendages to get my place designed. How much is it <span>going to cost me?<span></h3>
<div class = "answer"> <p>Havenly offers design services for a flat fee per room. Your fee covers the initial phone consultation, two concept boards, three product revisions, one final visualization, and complimentary purchasing services. We source your items from retailers and wholesalers, and try our best to fit your budget. Usually, we can't get you a beautiful leather club chair for $25, but we definitely can pretty any place up. 
</p></div>

</div><div class = "question">
<h3>When do I find out how much the <span>entire room costs?</span></h3>
<div  class = "answer"><p>Your final cost will consist of the flat design fee, cost of the furnishings, shipping and sales tax. When your designer sends you your final rendering, you will receive an items list with all of the prices, along with a shipping estimation and sales tax for your state. We keep your budget in mind from the start though.</p></div>
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3> But I’m poor! Kind of. <span>I have a small budget - can you guys still help me?</span></h3>
<div  class = "answer"><p>Yes! We believe that everyone has the right to a beautiful home, even if you're not one of those kids from My Super Sweet 16. Your designer will ask you about your budget, and source items and furnishings that fit within what you can afford. Even if you can’t buy everything at once, you can always sign back in and purchase from your personalized design package at a later date, as long as the items are available.</p></div>
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3> Okay, this all sounds good. However, I don’t really have that much time to devote to this but I just want my new room designed. <span>How much of a time commitment is it on my part?</span></h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>You can give your designer as much feedback or as little feedback as you’d like – it’s totally up to you how involved you’d like to be within the design process. We built Havenly so that all of us, even people who don’t have strong opinions on pillow fabrics, can live in a gorgeous space.</p></div>
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3>What <span>kind of items</span> do you source?</h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>We use a mix of retailers and wholesalers to make sure that we can design for all types of tastes, preferences, and budgets.   </p></div>
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3>Why <span>should I buy</span> the products from you?</h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>Because entering in your credit card, shipping address, billing address, name, phone number, etc. on nine different websites is incredibly annoying. We will do it for you since we love you all so much. You pay retail price (same as if you were to go to the retailers themselves) and we will guarantee lowest price in the off chance that you find an item for a lower price elsewhere. We also have access to some pretty awesome retailers that work exclusively with interior designers. Also, we will work with you to accommodate any special requests that we can (in-store pickups, delivery coordination, etc). </p></div>

</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3>Okay so then why are my <span>shipping costs</span> so darned high?</h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>The shipping costs we quote are directly from our vendors, and we will always be transparent with what they charge. </p></div> 
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3><span>What is this white glove delivery</span> you keep talking about in my final invoice?</h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>For some of the larger furniture items (bed, couch, chairs, tables, etc), your items will arrive via in-home delivery service. The items will ship via ground and the delivery service will contact you to set up an appointment within a four hour window for which day is most convenient for you. The delivery service will unpack and inspect the items, set the items up, and remove any packaging. Trust us, it's way more fun than trying to fit your couch in your car.</p></div>
</div>
<div class = "question">
<h3>What about <span>returns?</span></h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>Each vendor has specific return policies, but most items are able to be returned, if they are in new condition, within 30 days – shipping and restocking fees may apply. Some customized items may be non-refundable, those items, however, will be clearly marked and your designer will always let you know about any return policies. 
</p></div></div>
<div class = "question">
<h3> Yay!  So my decorator is, like, <span>my new BFF, right</span>? She's going to come shopping with me and have cocktails with me, and install all my stuff, right?</h3>
<div class = "answer"><p>As fun as our decorators are to drink with (trust us, we know), the reason why we are so much cheaper than traditional interior design services is because we take out the on-site consultations and installations. Feel free to email your designer for any last minute questions, and to rave about your new space! </p></div>
