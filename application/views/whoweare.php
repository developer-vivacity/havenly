Havenly was started by two sisters, neither of whom could satisfactorily sort through all the clutter to figure out how to get the best items for their rooms.  Interior decorators seemed way out of reach, and the prospect of doing it on their own seemed too time consuming for their busy lives.
<br><br>
The philosophy of Havenly is that everyone should be able to afford and access a beautifully decorated room.  And the team is working to fulfill that vision.</p>
